## 👨‍💻 **What is this?**
Bloxlink Helper is a bot created by [Dark](https://discord.com/users/449245847767482379) for [Bloxlink HQ](https://discord.gg/bloxlink). Mainly handling tags to make it easier to provide support, also provides other automations and commands such as API requests command to the Bloxlink API or an integrated FAQ system and tickets system using [Mongo DB](https://mongodb.com).

This was my first *actual* project (not as a joke) that is being used, in a company I love. Not the best at Python but trying my best, heh.
Thanks to [Nub](https://discord.com/users/156872400145874944) and [Mich](https://discord.com/users/431480956990390272) for helping me.

## 🛠️ **Contributing**
Why not? It is open source, at least help me make it better. 😭
