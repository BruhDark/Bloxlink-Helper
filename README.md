# :robot: Bloxlink Helper

## üë®‚Äçüíª **What is this?**

Bloxlink Helper was a bot created for Bloxlink's support server (not used anymore). Mainly handling tags to make it easier to provide support, also provides other automations and commands such as API requests command to the Bloxlink API or an integrated FAQ system and tickets system using [Mongo DB](https://mongodb.com).

This was my first *actual* project (not as a joke) that is being used, in a company I love. Not the best at Python but trying my best, heh.
